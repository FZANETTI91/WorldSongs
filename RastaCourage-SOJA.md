# Rasta Courage - SOJA :peace_symbol:



Try and remember now just what has been done
Enslavement, displacement of every nation
And now to one nation, everyone hold their grudge
Kind of makes me wonder about which side I'm on
Don't defend no white, and I don't defend black
I defend truth and rights and all of that
I work on situations where I'm at
Hold my position and never fall of track

**Nah give up my faith!**
Though Babylon rage
I and I will strive until
The end of my days, Rasta courage
Go against society, Rasta courage

Babylon rage
I and I will strive until
The end of my days, Rasta courage
Go against society, Rasta courage

I never give no good vibes
And I never give up no truth
Never trade my sanity for living in Babylon crew
Vanity will never drive this man insane
This man will walk alongside Jah again
We see all of the pressure to conform today
And I may sometimes bend
But only as not to break
Cause a life of iniquity for laziness' sake
Is a deal with the devil rasta just can't make

Nah give up my faith!
Though Babylon rage
I and I will strive until
The end of my days, Rasta courage
Go against society, Rasta courage

Babylon rage
I and I will strive until
The end of my days, Rasta courage
Go against society, Rasta courage

Looking back now upon all of the evidence
Four hundred years and what those years have
Really done, we talk of peace but at the
First sign of war. Bredren and bredren and
Sistren ain't sistren no more. Without forgiveness
How will any war cease, while the heathen rage?
Rastaman, sitting at ease. No one will move a
Muscle for some moral justice and with no justice there will be no peace

Nah give up my faith!
Though babylon rage
I and I will strive until
The end of my days, rasta courage
Go against society, rasta courage

The Babylon rage
I and I will strive until
The end of my days, rasta courage
Go against society, rasta courage

Nah give up my faith!
Though babylon rage
I and I will strive until
The end of my days, rasta courage
Go against society, rasta courage

Looking back now upon all of the evidence
Four hundred years and what those years have
Really done, we talk of peace but at the
First sign of war. Bredren and bredren and
Sistren ain't sistren no more. Without forgiveness
How will any war cease, while the heathen rage?
Rastaman, sitting at ease. No one will move a
Muscle for some moral justice and with no justice there will be no peace.
